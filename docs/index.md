## Overview

**[NVIDIA Cosmos™](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/cosmos/)** is a platform of state-of-the-art generative world foundation models (WFMs), guardrails, and an accelerated data processing and curation pipeline. This cookbook serves as a practical guide to the Cosmos open models--offering step-by-step workflows, technical recipes, and concrete examples for building, adapting, and deploying WFMs. It helps developers reproduce successful Cosmos model deployments and customize them for their specific domains.

The Cosmos ecosystem supports the complete Physical AI development lifecycle--from inference using pre-trained models to custom post-training for domain adaptation. Inside, you'll find the following:

- Quick-start inference examples to get up and running fast.
- Advanced post-training workflows for domain-specific fine-tuning.
- Proven recipes for scalable, production-ready deployments.

## Cosmos Models for Physical AI

The Cosmos family of open models consists of five core repositories, each targeting specific capabilities in the AI development workflow:

**[Cosmos Curator](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-curate)** - A GPU-accelerated video curation pipeline built on Ray. Supports multi-model analysis, content filtering, annotation, and deduplication for both inference and training data preparation.

**[Cosmos Predict](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-predict2.5)** - A diffusion transformer for future state prediction. Provides text-to-image and video-to-world generation capabilities, with specialized variants for robotics and simulation. Supports custom training for domain-specific prediction tasks.

**[Cosmos Transfer](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-transfer2.5)** - A multi-control video generation system with ControlNet and MultiControlNet conditioning (including depth, segmentation, LiDAR, and HDMap). Includes 4K upscaling capabilities and supports training for custom control modalities and domain adaptation.

**[Cosmos Reason](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-reason1)** - A 7B vision-language model for physically grounded reasoning. Handles spatial/temporal understanding and chain-of-thought tasks, with fine-tuning support for embodied AI applications and domain-specific reasoning.

**[Cosmos RL](https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-rl)** - A distributed training framework supporting both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning approaches. Features elastic policy rollout, FP8/FP4 precision support, and optimization for large-scale VLM and LLM training.

All models include pre-trained checkpoints and support custom training for domain-specific adaptation. The diagram below illustrates component interactions across inference and training workflows.

## ML/Gen AI Concepts

The cookbook is organized around key concepts spanning (controlled) **inference** and **training** use cases:

**1. [Prompt Guide](core_concepts/prompt_guide/overview.md)** - Learn effective prompting strategies for Cosmos models. This covers message structure, media ordering, sampling parameters, and domain-specific patterns to help you get the best results from Cosmos Reason and other vision-language models.

**2. [Control Modalities](core_concepts/control_modalities/overview.md)** - Master precise control over video generation with Cosmos Transfer 2.5 using Edge, Depth, Segmentation, and Vis modalities. This covers structural preservation, semantic replacement, lighting consistency, and multi-control approaches for achieving high-fidelity, controllable video transformations.

**3. [Data Curation](core_concepts/data_curation/overview.md)** - Use Cosmos Curator to prepare your datasets with modular, scalable processing pipelines. This includes splitting, captioning, filtering, deduplication, task-specific sampling, and cloud-native or local execution.

**4. [Model Post-Training](core_concepts/post_training/overview.md)** - Fine-tune foundation models using your curated data. This covers domain adaptation for Predict (2 and 2.5), Transfer (1 and 2.5), and Reason 1, setup for supervised fine-tuning, LoRA, or reinforcement learning, and use of Cosmos RL for large-scale distributed rollout.

**5. [Evaluation and Quality Control](core_concepts/evaluation/overview.md)** - Ensure your post-trained models are aligned and robust through metrics, visualization, and qualitative inspection. Leverage Cosmos Reason 1 as a quality filter (e.g. for synthetic data rejection sampling).

**6. [Model Distillation](core_concepts/distillation/overview.md)** - Compress large foundation models into smaller, efficient variants while preserving performance. This includes knowledge distillation techniques for Cosmos models, teacher-student training setups, and deployment optimization for edge devices and resource-constrained environments.
